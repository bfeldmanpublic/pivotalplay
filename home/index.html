				<span class="testimonialsText">"After not making my middle school team in seventh grade, I was even more motivated to master my skills and work hard to be the best player I could be. I joined a new team which Ali trains, and liked her so much, we asked to do private classes with her. She worked me hard and pushed me out of my comfort zone, but never failed to encourage me. Not only is she an amazing coach, but she is also understanding and makes it fun. After working with her for a couple of months, I tried out for my school's team in eighth grade and made it! She built up my confidence and I am so thankful that I was able to get individual coaching from her."
