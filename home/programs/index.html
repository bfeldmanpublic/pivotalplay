Group sessions (2+ players) are great for those players who need to work on more game-like situations. We will work on ball skills to increase their speed of play. We will also focus on tactics of the game (decision making, positioning on the field, how and when to attack and defend). Players will work a lot on enhancing their play in pressure situations. These are 1 hour lessons that come in packages of 6 or 10.
